Key takeaways I learned from my first CRUD app:
- Plan a UI thoroughly before diving into code (I should have used a dropdown menu instead of tons of buttons as that got messy)
- Understand what database design best serves your app's goals (I should have made a separate model for Steps, instead I just kept them as an array of strings)
- Don't be afraid to start over if things get too messy
- Code organization matters (I originally had a giant recipe.js module in my client to store the CRUD operations but decided to separate them for an easier dev exp)
- Don't give up, even if it takes you 3 weeks past the original deadline. I learned so much from this project and am much better off for it
